The APGG (Asymmetric Public Goods Games) C++ framework offers an easy to use environment in which evolutionary asymmetric public goods games can be modeled and simulated. The modular architecture allows for a vast amount of scenarios for different public goods games setups and experiments, using easy to change parameters. This includes experiments on well mixed and structured populations as well as experiments with symmetric and asymmetric payoffs. It also features group level payoffs and individual payoffs, and different evolutionary selectors and repopulators.
Results are automatically saved in semantic and descriptive structures and can be easily visualized with the included Python script.
This paper aims to explain the functionality and the structure of our framework, to show off the workflow that APGG follows, to present the different modules that are available to use and to show how APGG can be used to run public goods games experiments, using a sample scenario,
